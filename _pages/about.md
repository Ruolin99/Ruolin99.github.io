# About Me

Here is **Ruolin Shi** (Chinese: Áü≥Ëã•Áê≥).

Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. degree in the College of Transportation at Tongji University, Shanghai, China, under the supervision of Prof. [Xuesong Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=qPNyQCsAAAAJ). My research interests lie in the intersection of decision-making and motion planning for automated vehicles, trajectory prediction, scenario generation, and digitalized traffic rules.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would like to chat and collaborate, please email me at [2111224@tongji.edu.cn](mailto:2111224@tongji.edu.cn).
