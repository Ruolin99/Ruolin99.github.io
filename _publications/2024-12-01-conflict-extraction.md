This paper presents a comprehensive framework for extracting and analyzing traffic conflicts at signalized intersections using high-resolution trajectory data. The study develops novel conflict detection algorithms and analyzes conflict characteristics under different traffic conditions, providing valuable insights for intersection safety improvement and traffic management.

The methodology combines trajectory data processing with conflict detection algorithms, enabling the identification of various conflict types including crossing conflicts, merging conflicts, and rear-end conflicts at signalized intersections. The analysis reveals patterns in conflict occurrence related to signal timing, traffic flow, and geometric design features.

**Key contributions:**
- Novel conflict extraction methodology using trajectory data
- Comprehensive analysis of conflict characteristics
- Insights for intersection safety improvements
