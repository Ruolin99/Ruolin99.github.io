This paper presents a comprehensive framework for digitizing traffic rules to guide automated vehicle trajectory planning. The proposed approach integrates traffic rule formalization with motion planning algorithms, enabling automated vehicles to make safe and rule-compliant trajectory decisions.

The methodology involves translating complex traffic rules into computational constraints that can be incorporated into trajectory planning algorithms. The framework addresses the challenge of rule interpretation in dynamic traffic environments and provides a systematic approach for rule-aware motion planning.

**Key contributions:**
- Framework for digitizing traffic rules for automated vehicles
- Integration of traffic rules with trajectory planning algorithms
- Rule-compliant motion planning in complex traffic scenarios
- Validation through real-world traffic scenarios
