RuleNet is a specialized framework for safety-aware multi-agent trajectory prediction in ambiguous traffic scenarios. The proposed method integrates graph attention networks with rule-based robustness attention mechanisms to simultaneously predict future trajectories of multiple traffic participants while evaluating trajectory safety.

The framework addresses critical challenges in multi-agent trajectory prediction by incorporating traffic rule priorities and safety constraints. RuleNet combines temporal graph attention for modeling agent interactions with a novel robustness attention mechanism that enforces rule-based safety constraints.

**Key contributions:**
- Rule-priority-aware trajectory prediction framework
- Integration of graph attention networks with rule-based safety mechanisms
- Multi-agent trajectory prediction with safety evaluation
- Robust performance in ambiguous traffic scenarios
